# RNavigation
This is a React Native codebase, done to learn [how to navigate between screens using RN](https://aboutreact.com/react-native-stack-navigation/#React-Navigation).

## Description
This repository includes the codes for two separate hands-on works: "RNavigation" for the aforementioned navigating, and "RNavigation2" for learning to utilize [splash, login, and sign up with RN](https://aboutreact.com/react-native-login-and-signup/). It was done using React Native, Visual Studio Code, and Android Studio. CLI - (Administrator) Command Prompt/PowerShell was also used for a big chunk of the actual coding.

## Step-by-step guide - *"How do I actually use this site?"*
This is a University practice project, but the codes should run just fine if you wish to download the directories.

While there are a few ways to get it running, the easiest is via Command Prompt. You can see the prerequisites to this process [here](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup?guide=native#:~:text=Installing%20dependencies).

Once you've navigated to the directory of the project you're trying to run (`cd`[insert file path here]), you can run metro (`npm start`) and android/iOS (`npm run android`/`npx react-native run android`), connecting your project to an emulator from Android Studio. 

If you use Visual Studio Code as your IDE, you can open it up from the CLI file directory with the command: `code .`, and for troubleshooting `npm react-native doctor` works well.

Remember to check that your React Native, SDK, and Gradle versions are correct and work together!

## Status
The development of this project is complete for the foreseeable future.
